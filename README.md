- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rgmelvin (Rich Melvin)
- I am formally trained as a molecular biologist/ biochemist. My most general interest is in how living things adapt to their nutrient environments at the cellular level.
- My favorite research has been on how the nutrient environment selects specific mitochondrial DNA genomes and how those genomes interact with the nuclear genome.
- During the pandemic years I worked to establish wastewater monitoring of SARS CoV-2 in waste water in the state of Minnesota. I also monitored virus in Lake Superior water.
- Over the past 2 years I have been developing my Rust/Anchor, Typescript, skills through self study and participating in the Turbin3 program.
- My programming goal is to develop Solana-based dApps that scientists and others can use to preserve and share data and real world biological assets (and make some profit from it).
- I am also interested in developing DAOs that support research, games that incorporate research problems, and ways to provide access to physical scientific infrastructure.
- I am interested in any collaboration where I can contribute to web3 solutions for science.
