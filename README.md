- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rgmelvin (Rich Melvin)
- I am a molecular biologist/ biochemist. My most general interest is in how living things adapt to their nutrient environments at the cellular level.
- My current research studies how the nutrient environment selects specific mitochondrial DNA genomes and how those genomes interact with the nuclear genome.
- During the pandemic years I worked to establish wastewater monitoring of SARS CoV-2 in waste water in the state of Minnesota. I also monitored virus
- in Lake Superior water.
- Over the past 2 years I have been developing my Python, R, and Solidity skills through bootcamps and self study.
- My programming goal is to develop software tools for data analysis, modeling the biology that I am interested in, and designing blockchain applications for
- biology. 
- I am interested in any collaboration that involves Test Driven Development of Python or Solidity applications.
